Below is a self-contained “sanity-check kit” for the 4⁄5 shortcut.  Use as many of the cross-checks as you need; if several agree you can be confident the approximation is behaving.

⸻

1  Re-derive σ from the shortcut and from the full model

step	quantity	formula	comment
1	σ̂ (approx)	\displaystyle \hat\sigma\;=\;\frac{5}{4}\;\frac{P_\text{straddle}}{S_0\sqrt{T}}	the 4⁄5-rule
2	σ (exact)	root-find σ such that model-price = market price	Black–Scholes, Bachelier, SABR …—whatever you priced with
3	error	\Delta\sigma = \hat\sigma - \sigma	want this “small” by your tolerance

If Δσ is within, say, 1–2 vol-bp for liquid ATM options you’re fine; if it grows, go to the next checks.

⸻

2  Translate vol error back into price space

Because straddle vega ≈ 0.8\,S_0\sqrt{T},

\Delta P_\text{straddle}\;\approx\;(\text{vega})\;\Delta\sigma
\;\approx\;0.8\,S_0\sqrt{T}\;\Delta\sigma.

If the implied-vol error of the shortcut creates only a couple of ticks in price, the shortcut is “good enough” for trading or monitoring.

3  Check the higher-order term that the 4⁄5-rule drops

For an ATM Black–Scholes straddle

P = S_0\sqrt{\tfrac{2}{\pi}}\left[
\sigma\sqrt{T}
- \frac{(\sigma\sqrt{T})^3}{24}
+ O\!\bigl((\sigma\sqrt{T})^5\bigr)
\right].

Diagnostic: compute x=\sigma\sqrt{T}.
If x<0.3 (e.g. 30 % vol and >1 y to expiry, or 10 % vol and 3 m) then the cubic term is at most 0.5 % of price ⇒ shortcut is nearly exact.
Once x creeps above ~0.5 the neglected term grows to >5 % of price and the shortcut drifts visibly.

4  Moneyness drift test

Compute the ratio

\frac{P_\text{straddle}}{S_0\sqrt{T}}

every minute inside your 30 min window.
If underlying stays truly ATM this ratio should stay flat (apart from vol moves); if you see monotonic trend it means the forward-price or strike drifted away from the ATM point and the 4⁄5 slope is no longer correct.

⸻

5  Bid-ask robustness

Spread amplification: when vega is small (near-expiry options) the vol you back-out from mid-price can jump by

\frac{\text{½ spread}}{\text{vega}}
\;\;\approx\;\;
\frac{\text{½ spread}}
{0.8\,S_0\sqrt{T}}.

Calculate that number; if it is larger than the vol change you hope to measure, use the exact inversion so you can at least quantify the uncertainty.

⸻

6  Visual cross-check (quick plot idea)

Plot on the same axis for each observation t_i:
	•	σ̂ from shortcut,
	•	σ exact from inversion,
	•	the difference Δσ (secondary axis).

When Δσ wiggles randomly around zero the shortcut is fine; when it shows systematic drift you have left the regime where the 4⁄5 linearisation is valid (usually because time-to-maturity is now small or because you are no longer exactly ATM).

⸻

Practical “go / no-go” thumb-rules

condition	use shortcut?
ATM within ±0.5 % strike, T≥5 d, \sigma≤40 \%	Yes—Δσ rarely >1 bp
Same but T<2 d or \sigma√T>0.6	Probably no—check error explicitly
Underlying moves >1 % inside the 30 min	No—re-centre or invert
You need vol precision <0.5 bp	Always invert

Follow those checks and you can validate (and, when necessary, abandon) the 4⁄5 shortcut with confidence.
