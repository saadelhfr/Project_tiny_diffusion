Thanks for clarifying—you’re trying to bin two separate datasets and then use a binned column as a categorical key to support a merge_asof, likely alongside timestamp matching.

When dealing with two datasets that need consistent binning, especially for merge_asof, here’s the step-by-step approach that ensures aligned bins and accurate joining:

⸻

1. Combine for Binning, Then Split

You must bin based on a shared bin definition. If you bin each dataset independently (even with the same method), the bins may not match exactly.

Solution:
	•	Concatenate the two datasets temporarily (just for the column you want to bin), define the bins, then apply those same bins back to each dataset.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Assume df1 and df2 both have 'value_column'

# Step 1: Log-transform
log_vals = np.log(pd.concat([df1['value_column'], df2['value_column']]))

# Step 2: Create shared bins (quantile-based or uniform)
# For quantile binning (better for exponential data):
bins = pd.qcut(log_vals, q=75, duplicates='drop', retbins=True)[1]  # returns bin edges

# Step 3: Bin each dataset with the same edges
df1['value_bin'] = pd.cut(np.log(df1['value_column']), bins=bins, labels=False, include_lowest=True)
df2['value_bin'] = pd.cut(np.log(df2['value_column']), bins=bins, labels=False, include_lowest=True)

Now, both df1 and df2 have aligned bin labels, and merge_asof will work properly.

2. Use merge_asof With the Binned Column

Ensure that:
	•	Both DataFrames are sorted by timestamp.
	•	You also sort by the value_bin if necessary.

# First, sort both datasets
df1 = df1.sort_values(['value_bin', 'timestamp'])
df2 = df2.sort_values(['value_bin', 'timestamp'])

# Then merge using 'value_bin' as the "by" key
merged = pd.merge_asof(
    df1,
    df2,
    on='timestamp',
    by='value_bin',
    direction='nearest',  # or 'backward', 'forward' depending on your logic
    tolerance=pd.Timedelta("10s")  # if needed
)

Key Points
	•	Always derive the bin boundaries from the combined data, even if you apply them separately.
	•	Choose quantile bins for better handling of exponential data.
	•	Keep track of bin width and count if max error is a concern.
	•	You can measure the post-merge value differences to empirically quantify error and tune the number of bins accordingly.

If you’d like, I can provide a function that automates this process for any two DataFrames and lets you experiment with different bin counts. Let me know!
