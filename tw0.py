Got it. You want a coherent structure for documenting your workflow on correctly siding trades by merging DTCC, TCA, and Minicops data, estimating execution prices, and analyzing bid-ask spreads. Here’s a recommended report structure tailored for clarity and emphasizing plots:

⸻

Trade Siding & Data Integration Report

1. Introduction
	•	Objective: Clearly state the goal of correctly determining the trade side by integrating DTCC, TCA, and Minicops data.
	•	Context: Briefly recall your previous work on time delays and data matching.
	•	Why it Matters: Explain the significance of accurate trade siding for downstream analysis (P&L attribution, TCA, market impact studies).

⸻

2. Data Sources & Preprocessing
	•	DTCC Data: Describe key fields used (execution price, timestamp, etc.).
	•	TCA Data: Mention prior matching work and fields leveraged (algo indicators, market data context).
	•	Minicops Data: Explain what Minicops provides (e.g., microstructure signals, order book snapshots).
	•	Data Cleaning & Merging:
	•	How DTCC & TCA were merged.
	•	Integration of Minicops data post-merge.
	•	Any challenges faced (e.g., time synchronization, missing fields).

Plot Idea: Data coverage heatmap per source, time alignment visualization.

⸻

3. Bid-Ask Spread Analysis
	•	Methodology:
	•	Selection of ATM 1M tenor straddle per currency pair.
	•	Calculation of bid-ask spread.
	•	Detection of price jumps.
	•	Rationale: Why spread and price jumps are crucial for ensuring data quality and identifying market conditions.

Plot Ideas:
	•	Bid-ask spread distribution per currency pair.
	•	Time-series of spread evolution highlighting price jumps.

⸻

4. Execution Price Estimation from DTCC Data
	•	Approach:
	•	Step-by-step process of estimating the execution price using DTCC data.
	•	Assumptions made (e.g., last traded price, indicative quotes).
	•	Validation: Comparison with known benchmarks or sanity checks.

Plot Ideas:
	•	Scatter plot: DTCC estimated price vs. actual quote mid-price.
	•	Residual histogram of estimation errors.

⸻

5. Trade Side Determination Logic
	•	Side Inference Process:
	•	Compare estimated execution price to reference mid-price.
	•	Define thresholds or rules to infer buyer-initiated vs seller-initiated trades.
	•	Handling ambiguous cases.
	•	Quality Control: Measures to ensure robustness (e.g., false positive rate analysis).

Plot Ideas:
	•	Trade side classification accuracy plot.
	•	Time evolution of sided trades.
	•	Confusion matrix comparing inferred sides vs. known (if available).

⸻

6. Results & Insights
	•	Summary of Findings:
	•	Success rate of trade siding.
	•	Observed patterns across currency pairs.
	•	Notable anomalies or challenges.
	•	Impact of Minicops Data:
	•	Quantitative improvement in trade siding after Minicops integration.

Plot Ideas:
	•	Before/After comparison of siding accuracy.
	•	Case study plots for interesting trade sequences.

⸻

7. Conclusion & Next Steps
	•	Recap of the implemented methodology and key results.
	•	Limitations and assumptions to be aware of.
	•	Potential improvements (e.g., machine learning classifiers, deeper order book analysis).
	•	Roadmap for further work (e.g., real-time siding, integration in TCA workflow).

⸻

8. Appendix
	•	Technical details of data transformations.
	•	Code snippets or pseudocode.
	•	Additional plots for edge cases or less critical results.
